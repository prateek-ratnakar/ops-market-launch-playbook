\ud83e\udded The Core Problem This Solves
Most ops teams launching into new international markets treat it as a project \u2014 a checklist of tasks with a go-live date.
That's why most launches have defects.
A market launch is actually a system design problem: you're standing up a new operating model \u2014 people, technology, policy, quality, and culture \u2014 in a context you've never operated in before, often under regulatory scrutiny, often with a hard deadline.
This playbook treats it that way.
\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f The 4-Pillar Launch Architecture
Every successful market launch needs all four pillars ready simultaneously. Missing even one causes launch defects.

Zero-defect launches happen when all 4 pillars hit green simultaneously.
The playbook gives you the framework to track each pillar independently and converge them on launch day.
\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Framework Contents
1. People & Capacity Planning Model
How to size, hire, train, and ramp a workforce for a market you've never operated in.
Key decisions this model answers:
How many investigators/agents do you need on Day 1 vs. Month 3?
What's the productivity ramp curve for a new market (hours to proficiency)?
How do you staff for uncertainty when volume forecasts are unreliable?
What's your contingency headcount buffer and when do you trigger it?
Key insight: New market volume is always wrong in the forecast. Design your staffing model around a range, not a point estimate. Build a 20% contingency buffer that can be activated within 2 weeks.
2. Technology & Tooling Readiness Checklist
The 100+ product feature validation framework used before every launch.
Feature categories covered:
Core workflow tools (case routing, investigation platforms, dashboards)
Language and localization readiness (UI, notifications, help content)
Reporting and analytics (can leadership see the new market's data?)
Integration dependencies (what breaks if an upstream system is unavailable?)
Fallback and manual override procedures (what's the plan if tech fails on Day 1?)
Key insight: Tech readiness is binary for launch \u2014 it either works or it doesn't. Build a RAG (Red/Amber/Green) tracker for every feature. Nothing launches with a Red item unmitigated.
3. Policy Localization & Regulatory Compliance Guide
How to localize 1,000+ policies for a new market while meeting local legal requirements.
EU market considerations covered:
GDPR data handling requirements for investigation workflows
Right-to-explanation obligations in automated decision systems
Local labor law implications for workforce
